# Command Box


This project contains two subprojects for the RPL command box. The first is the
code running on the command box itself while the second is the code running
on a thethered base station.

## How to run

Make sure both scripts are uploaded to the correct arduinos. PT_READER is hooked
up to the PTs while PT_RECIVER is hooked up to the computer. After hooking up
the PTs to A0-A15 connect the two arduinos. Make sure to connect A to A and
B to B for the RS485 modules.

To write the data to disk run the python script in DataWriter. To do this change
into the data write directory and execute.

```bash
python DataWriter.py /dev/COMMPORT outputfile.csv
```

/dev/COMMPORT is the port you used to upload to the arduino in the arduino IDE
while outputfile.csv is the name of the file that is written to disk.
